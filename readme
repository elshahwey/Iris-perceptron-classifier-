Iris Perceptron Classifier üå∏

This is a simple machine learning project where I used the **Perceptron algorithm** to classify the famous **Iris dataset**.

The project was done as part of my learning journey in machine learning. It focuses on implementing and training a basic Perceptron model from scratch (or using `sklearn`) for classification.

# üìÇ Project Structure

- `iris_perceptron_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation
- (Optional) `requirements.txt`: For dependencies if needed

---

# What the project does

- Loads the Iris dataset ( from  CSV)
- Preprocesses the features and labels
- Trains a **Perceptron model** to classify Iris flowers into:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
- Evaluates the model using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for plots)

## üìå Notes

This is a beginner-friendly project done during my ML learning path.  
The goal was to get hands-on experience with:
- Binary vs Multi-class classification
- Using Perceptron for supervised learning
- Data preprocessing and evaluation

## üß† Future Improvements

- Try other classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Apply cross-validation
- Build a simple UI or web app using Streamlit
